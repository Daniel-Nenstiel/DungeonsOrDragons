You gain a mental image from the object’s point of view, showing the last creature to hold the object, regardless of how long ago it was last handled. You also learn	of any events that have occurred within 20 feet of the object within the past 24 hours. The	events you perceive unfold from	the object’s perspective. You see and hear such events as if you were there, but can’t use other senses.</p>

            <p class="indent">You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn’t possible.</p>
